## Usage

The application contains various components that can be accessed via the navigation links. Each component demonstrates different functionalities of Angular.

## Components

### 1. Data Binding Component
Demonstrates one-way and two-way data binding.

### 2. Structural Directive Component
Shows how to use Angular structural directives like `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, and `*ngSwitch`.

### 3. Assignment Component
Contains examples of control statements and their implementations.

### 4. Pipes Component
Demonstrates the use of built-in pipes and custom pipes.

### 5. Form Validation Component
Includes examples of template-driven forms with validation.

### 6. Reactive Form Component
Demonstrates the usage of reactive forms and form controls.

### 7. API Components
- **GET API**: Fetches user data from an external API.
- **POST API**: Sends data to an external API.

## Routing

The application uses Angular Router for navigation. The routing configuration is set in `app-routing.module.ts` where different paths are mapped to their respective components.

## Forms

The application features both reactive and template-driven forms, showcasing form controls, validation, and submission.

## API Calls

The app interacts with external APIs for fetching and sending data. The implementation is done using Angular's HttpClient module.
